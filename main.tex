Over the last years,



\gls{rtos} are systems developed to handle the processing of tasks with timing constraints, where it is necessary to
ensure that the deadlines for the tasks are met. These systems can be classified as hard or soft based on their
capabilities and requirements. Hard \gls{rtos} are used in situations where the failure to meet a deadline in the
execution of a task can have severe consequences, this includes industrial systems, autonomous vehicles, avionic
systems and others. Alternatively, soft \gls{rtos} are used in non-critical contexts, where deadline misses can be
tolerated to a certain degree. Multimedia and audio processing are examples of contexts where a soft \gls{rtos} might
be used \cite[13--22]{kopetz2022real}.

The deterministic execution of tasks is ensured by real-time scheduling algorithms, which are responsible for their
prioritization. These algorithms must order the tasks in such a way that their timing constraints are satisfied, for
that, the execution time, deadlines and other aspects of tasks can be considered. Schedulers that set the priorities
before the execution of the system are classified as static, while those that set the priorities at runtime are
classified as dynamic \cite[247--248]{kopetz2022real}.

Currently, several processor architectures are multi-core, allowing real parallelism in task execution. These
architectures introduce challenges in the implementation of real-time schedulers, as the use of shared resources, such
as the memory, cache and input/output can affect the execution time of tasks in non-deterministic ways
\cite{aceituno2023optimized, lugo2022survey}. Moreover, there are also problems related to the efficient usage of the
cores, such as load balancing \cite{jadon2024comprehensive}. Overall, the complexity of real-time task scheduling in
multi-core \gls{rtos} can require more sophisticated schedulers.

% TODO: Justify this better
Considering this scenario, different scheduling techniques have been proposed over the last years. Some of them apply
heuristics, such as genetic algorithms, to optimize the system's performance. There is also the utilization of
\gls{ml}, mainly with \gls{rl} \cite{hassan2025optimizing, liang2024adaptive}. The utilization of \gls{ml} is useful
for capturing patterns and learn how to adapt the scheduling to the state of the system. However, this technique can
introduce a significant overhead, which is an often overlooked impact.

% Inference?
% TODO: Check the genitives
This study proposes the development of an adaptive dynamic scheduler for multi-core \gls{rtos} that will be guided by a
\gls{ml} model, focusing on the improvement of the system's performance while keeping a low overhead. The
prioritization policy of the tasks will be based on the inference realized by the \gls{ml} model over the temporal
evolution of the system's state. This will allow the tasks to be scheduled with the consideration of factors that
affect the timing.

\section{Research Problem}

Several works in the field of \gls{rtos} proposed methods to solve pertinent problems introduced by multi-core systems,
most of them in the context of embedded systems \cite{ismael2021scheduling}. The interference between tasks caused by
the usage of shared resources and load balancing are problems that have been the focus of several researchers. However,
solutions for these problems are still limited by aspects such as the heterogeneity of architectures, scalability,
workload variations and other intrinsic problems to scheduling algorithms \cite{lugo2022survey,
	jadon2024comprehensive}. Overall, the complexity of these systems leads to difficulties in the implementation of
schedulers.

The dynamic context of these systems opens opportunities for the application of \gls{ml}. Research in this area focuses
on several objectives, such as the optimization of schedulers through \gls{rl} and also in optimization for
heterogeneous architectures through \gls{drl} \cite{liang2024adaptive, tan2024deep}. The power efficiency is also
relevant, with several works applying \gls{ml} with techniques, such as \gls{drl}, \gls{lstm} networks, linear
regression and \glspl{cnn} \cite{peng2024energy, allaqband2024efficient, khan2025enhanced}. These solutions apply
\gls{ml} in order to model the behavior of the system and applications, analyzing performance metrics and relevant data
about tasks. With these models, it is possible to make decisions about prioritization.

Nonetheless, the research in the area is still limited. There is a lack of focus on aspects such as the overhead
introduced by \gls{ml} models. The dynamic context of task creation, destruction and workload variation is also
underexplored. There is still space for the exploration of the application of \gls{ml} techniques in this field with
the consideration of these aspects. This scenario leads to questions that are still unanswered:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Can a \gls{ml} model learn to capture the evolving state of the dynamic environment of task creation,
	      evolution and destruction based on system metrics?
	\item How can a \gls{ml} model be introduced in a multi-core \gls{rtos} without causing a significant overhead that
	      invalidates its use?
	\item Will the usage of a \gls{ml} informed scheduler result in a more reliable system with a lower jitter?
\end{itemize}

\section{Objectives}

The general objective of this research is to develop an adaptive \gls{ml} guided scheduler for multi-core \gls{rtos}
aiming to improve the performance and reliability of the system under evolving scenarios.

\subsection{Specific Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Contribute to the production of a systematic literature review in the context of the application of
	      \gls{ml} in multi-core \gls{rtos};
	\item Present an analysis of the impact of the overhead introduced by \gls{ml} models in \gls{rtos};
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}

This work will be conducted as an applied research and will approach the problem with qualitative analyses. The
research will also take an exploratory approach to the subject, identifying the viability, advantages and disadvantages
of the proposed solution.

The initial step is comprised of a systematic literature review that will explore the state of the art in the
application of \gls{ml} in multi-core \gls{rtos}, with a special focus in the context of scheduling algorithms.
Moreover, the next step will be the creation of datasets of metrics collected during the execution of tasks in evolving
scenarios, including workload variation, usage of synchronizers, input/output and other aspects. After this step, the
model and scheduler will be developed with the application of concepts from the work of \citet{horstmann2019framework}.
The solution will be validated with practical experiments and data collection on \gls{epos} \cite{epos}. Lastly, the
results will be analyzed, where it will be possible to answer the research questions.
