% Context and relevancy
% TODO: Add sources for the utilization of RTOS in these areas
Currently, several areas of technology require software that must execute in real-time. This often includes autonomous vehicles, aviation, robotics, industrial systems, and other critical systems where the software is directly responsible for system safety and control. In these domains, a failure to meet timing constraints during execution can lead to severe consequences. Thus, to ensure predictable execution and meet these timing requirements, \gls{rtos} are utilized.

% Definition of RTOS
\gls{rtos} are systems developed to handle the deterministic processing of tasks, where it is necessary to ensure that the deadlines for the tasks are met. These systems can be classified as hard or soft based on their capabilities and requirements. Hard \gls{rtos} are used in situations where the failure to meet a deadline in the execution of a task can have severe consequences, this includes the areas cited previously. Alternatively, soft \gls{rtos} are used in non-critical contexts, where deadline misses can be tolerated to a certain degree. Multimedia and audio processing are examples of contexts where a soft \gls{rtos} might be used \cite[13--22]{kopetz2022real}.

% Definition of scheduling algorithms
The deterministic execution of tasks is ensured by real-time scheduling algorithms, which are responsible for their prioritization. These algorithms must order the tasks in such a way that their timing constraints are satisfied, for that, the execution time, deadlines and other aspects of tasks can be considered. Schedulers that set the priorities before the execution of the system are classified as static, while those that set the priorities at runtime are classified as dynamic \cite[247--248]{kopetz2022real}.

% TODO: Move this somewhere else
% TODO: Check the genitives
This study proposes the development of an adaptive dynamic scheduler for multi-core \gls{rtos} that will be guided by a \gls{ml} model, focusing on the improvement of the system's performance while keeping a low overhead. The prioritization policy of the tasks will be based on the inference realized by the \gls{ml} model over the temporal evolution of the system's state. This will allow the tasks to be scheduled with the consideration of factors that affect the timing.

\subsection{Research Problem}

% Introduction to the problems
% TODO: Check if it's ok to say the execution is faster
Most modern processors adopt a multi-core implementation, which allows tasks to be executed in parallel. This design offers many advantages, such as the higher efficiency with a faster execution speed and improved power efficiency. However, multi-core processors also introduce several challenges \cite{sethi2015multicore}.

% Problems
One of the major challenges introduced by multi-core processors is interference, which arises from task contention for shared resources such as main memory, caches, and I/O peripherals. This contention introduces non-deterministic delays into task execution, making it difficult to accurately estimate the \gls{wcet}. This interference affects the scheduler's ability to guarantee that tasks will meet their deadlines, thus compromising system reliability \cite{aceituno2023optimized, lugo2022survey}. Moreover, heterogeneous multi-core processors also introduce challenges, since they present cores with different characteristics from each other. This requires more sophisticated schedulers and is a subject of attention for load balancing mechanisms. Furthermore, the dynamism and variation of tasks' workloads is another challenge. Tasks may evolve through time, changing their resource utilization and demands, which might require adaptive schedulers \cite{mrabet2024scheduling, jadon2024comprehensive}.

% TODO: Solution

Several works in the field of \gls{rtos} proposed methods to solve pertinent problems introduced by multi-core systems,
most of them in the context of embedded systems \cite{ismael2021scheduling}. The interference between tasks caused by
the usage of shared resources and load balancing are problems that have been the focus of several researchers. However,
solutions for these problems are still limited by aspects such as the heterogeneity of architectures, scalability,
workload variations and other intrinsic problems to scheduling algorithms \cite{lugo2022survey,
jadon2024comprehensive}. Overall, the complexity of these systems leads to difficulties in the implementation of
schedulers.

% TODO: Justify this better
Considering this scenario, different scheduling techniques have been proposed over the last years. Some of them apply heuristics, such as genetic algorithms, to optimize the system's performance. There is also the utilization of \gls{ml}, mainly with \gls{rl} \cite{hassan2025optimizing, liang2024adaptive}. The utilization of \gls{ml} is useful for capturing patterns and learn how to adapt the scheduling to the state of the system. However, this technique can introduce a significant overhead, which is an often overlooked impact.

The dynamic context of these systems opens opportunities for the application of \gls{ml}. Research in this area focuses
on several objectives, such as the optimization of schedulers through \gls{rl} and also in optimization for
heterogeneous architectures through \gls{drl} \cite{liang2024adaptive, tan2024deep}. The power efficiency is also
relevant, with several works applying \gls{ml} with techniques, such as \gls{drl}, \gls{lstm} networks, linear
regression and \glspl{cnn} \cite{peng2024energy, allaqband2024efficient, khan2025enhanced}. These solutions apply
\gls{ml} in order to model the behavior of the system and applications, analyzing performance metrics and relevant data
about tasks. With these models, it is possible to make decisions about prioritization.

Nonetheless, the research in the area is still limited. There is a lack of focus on aspects such as the overhead
introduced by \gls{ml} models. The dynamic context of task creation, destruction and workload variation is also
underexplored. There is still space for the exploration of the application of \gls{ml} techniques in this field with
the consideration of these aspects. This scenario leads to questions that are still unanswered:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Can a \gls{ml} model learn to capture the evolving state of the dynamic environment of task creation,
	      evolution and destruction based on system metrics?
	\item How can a \gls{ml} model be introduced in a multi-core \gls{rtos} without causing a significant overhead that
	      invalidates its use?
	\item Will the usage of a \gls{ml} informed scheduler result in a more reliable system with a lower jitter?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Research Question}

\subsection{Objectives}

The general objective of this research is to develop an adaptive \gls{ml} guided scheduler for multi-core \gls{rtos}
aiming to improve the performance and reliability of the system under evolving scenarios.

\subsubsection{Specific Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Contribute to the production of a systematic literature review in the context of the application of
	      \gls{ml} in multi-core \gls{rtos};
	\item Present an analysis of the impact of the overhead introduced by \gls{ml} models in \gls{rtos};
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}

This work will be conducted as an applied research and will approach the problem with qualitative analyses. The
research will also take an exploratory approach to the subject, identifying the viability, advantages and disadvantages
of the proposed solution.

The initial step is comprised of a systematic literature review that will explore the state of the art in the
application of \gls{ml} in multi-core \gls{rtos}, with a special focus in the context of scheduling algorithms.
Moreover, the next step will be the creation of datasets of metrics collected during the execution of tasks in evolving
scenarios, including workload variation, usage of synchronizers, input/output and other aspects. After this step, the
model and scheduler will be developed with the application of concepts from the work of \citet{horstmann2019framework}.
The solution will be validated with practical experiments and data collection on \gls{epos} \cite{epos}. Lastly, the
results will be analyzed, where it will be possible to answer the research questions.
